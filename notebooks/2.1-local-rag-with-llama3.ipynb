As\\nwe pre-train larger models, full ﬁne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example – deploying indepen-\\ndent instances of ﬁne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\\nexpensive. We propose Low-RankAdaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B ﬁne-tuned with Adam,\\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than ﬁne-\\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\\nno additional inference latency . We also provide an empirical investigation into\\nrank-deﬁciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efﬁcacy of\\nLoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch\\nmodels and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa,\\nDeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA .\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nPretrained \\nWeights\\n𝑊∈ℝ𝑑×𝑑\\nxh\\n𝐵=0\\n𝐴=𝒩(0,𝜎2)\\n𝑑𝑟Pretrained \\nWeights\\n𝑊∈ℝ𝑑×𝑑\\nxf(x)\\n𝑑\\nFigure 1: Our reparametriza-\\ntion.

Such adaptation is usually done via ﬁne-tuning ,\\nwhich updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The ma-\\njor downside of ﬁne-tuning is that the new model contains as many\\nparameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained\\nevery few months, this changes from a mere “inconvenience” for\\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a\\ncritical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with\\n175 billion trainable parameters.1\\nMany sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or\\nlearning external modules for new tasks.

More importantly, these method often fail to\\nmatch the ﬁne-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efﬁciency and model quality.\\nWe take inspiration from Li et al. (2018a); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned\\nover-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the\\nchange in weights during model adaptation also has a low “intrinsic rank”, leading to our proposed\\nLow-RankAdaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural\\nnetwork indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers’ change during\\nadaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3\\n175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., rin Figure 1 can be one or two) sufﬁces even\\nwhen the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efﬁcient.\\nLoRA possesses several key advantages.\\n• A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for dif-\\nferent tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efﬁciently switch tasks by replacing the\\nmatricesAandBin Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching over-\\nhead signiﬁcantly.\\n• LoRA makes training more efﬁcient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3\\ntimes when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or\\nmaintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,\\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\\n• Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully ﬁne-tuned model, by\\nconstruction.\\n• LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\\nas preﬁx-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\\nTerminologies and Conventions We make frequent references to the Transformer architecture\\nand use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions. We call the input and output di-\\nmension size of a Transformer layer dmodel . We useWq,Wk,Wv, andWoto refer to the\\nquery/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. WorW0refers to a pre-\\ntrained weight matrix and ∆Wits accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use rto\\ndenote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;\\nBrown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model\\noptimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn= 4×dmodel .\\n2 P ROBLEM STATEMENT\\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat-\\ning use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the\\nmaximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speciﬁc prompt.\\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model PΦ(y|x)parametrized by Φ.\\nFor instance, PΦ(y|x)can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown\\net al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this\\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\\nreading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is\\nrepresented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: Z={(xi,yi)}i=1,..,N, where both xiand\\nyiare sequences of tokens.

Thus, if the pre-trained model is large\\n(such as GPT-3 with |Φ0|≈175Billion), storing and deploying many independent instances of\\nﬁne-tuned models can be challenging, if at all feasible.\\nIn this paper, we adopt a more parameter-efﬁcient approach, where the task-speciﬁc parameter\\nincrement ∆Φ = ∆Φ(Θ) is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters Θwith\\n|Θ|≪| Φ0|.

When the pre-trained model is GPT-3 175B, the number of train-\\nable parameters|Θ|can be as small as 0.01% of|Φ0|.\\n3 A REN’TEXISTING SOLUTIONS GOOD ENOUGH ?\\nThe problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens\\nof works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efﬁcient. See Sec-\\ntion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there\\nare two prominent strategies when it comes to efﬁcient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby\\net al., 2019; Rebufﬁ et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R ¨uckl´e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms\\nof the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;\\nLiu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and\\nlatency-sensitive production scenario.\\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters. We focus\\non the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block\\nand a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional\\nLayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit-\\ning multi-task settings (R ¨uckl´e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass\\nthe extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed\\nto have few parameters (sometimes <1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck di-\\nmension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware\\nparallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes\\na difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a\\ngeneric scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b)\\nmedium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a\\nvery small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\\nThis problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al. (2020); Lep-\\nikhin et al. (2020), because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as\\nAllReduce andBroadcast , unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.\\nDirectly Optimizing the Prompt is Hard The other direction, as exempliﬁed by preﬁx tuning (Li\\n& Liang, 2021), faces a different challenge. We observe that preﬁx tuning is difﬁcult to optimize\\nand that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, conﬁrming similar\\nobservations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for\\nadaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task, which\\nwe suspect makes tuning the prompt less performant compared to other methods. We defer the study\\non task performance to Section 5.\\n3', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"

       " LoRA is a method that adapts large pre-trained language models to a specific task without fine-tuning the entire model. It does this by learning a set of additional parameters that are applied to the pre-trained model's weights, rather than updating the weights themselves. This allows LoRA to scale up to large models like GPT-3 while still achieving good performance on a variety of tasks. LoRA is particularly effective in low-data regimes and can be combined with other adaptation methods, such as prefix-embedding and prefix-layer tuning, to further improve performance. LoRA uses a measure of subspace similarity between the pre-trained model's weights and the task-specific weights to determine which weights to adapt. This allows LoRA to efficiently adapt the model to the task without overfitting or underfitting. LoRA has been shown to perform better than or at least on-par with other adaptation methods, including fine-tuning and prefix-based approaches, on a variety of tasks and datasets.  LoRA is a simple yet effective method for adapting large pre-trained language models to specific tasks, and it has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications.

Note\\nthat not all methods beneﬁt monotonically from having more trainable parameters, as shown in Fig-\\nure 2. We observe a signiﬁcant performance drop when we use more than 256 special tokens for\\npreﬁx-embedding tuning or more than 32 special tokens for preﬁx-layer tuning. This corroborates\\nsimilar observations in Li & Liang (2021). While a thorough investigation into this phenomenon\\nis out-of-scope for this work, we suspect that having more special tokens causes the input distri-\\nbution to shift further away from the pre-training data distribution. Separately, we investigate the\\nperformance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime in Section F.3.\\n6 7 8 9 10 11\\nlog10 # Trainable Parameters0.550.600.650.700.75Validation Accuracy\\nWikiSQL\\nMethod\\nFine-Tune\\nPrefixEmbed\\nPrefixLayer\\nAdapter(H)\\nLoRA\\n6 7 8 9 10 11\\nlog10 # Trainable Parameters0.840.860.880.900.92\\nMultiNLI-matched\\nFigure 2: GPT-3 175B validation accuracy vs. number of trainable parameters of several adaptation\\nmethods on WikiSQL and MNLI-matched.

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a sequence-to-sequence\\narchitecture that makes heavy use of self-attention. Radford et al. (a) applied it to autoregressive lan-\\nguage modeling by using a stack of Transformer decoders. Since then, Transformer-based language\\nmodels have dominated NLP, achieving the state-of-the-art in many tasks. A new paradigm emerged\\nwith BERT (Devlin et al., 2019b) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) – both are large Transformer lan-\\n8', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2924, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6277767358958708),\n",

We use the\\nsame hyperparameters for all datasets after tuning learning rate.\\nrally, we replace them after every Transformer block with an input agnostic vector. Thus, both the\\nembeddings and subsequent Transformer block activations are treated as trainable parameters. For\\nmore on preﬁx-layer tuning, see Section 5.1.\\nIn Table 15, we show the evaluation results of LoRA+PE and LoRA+PL on WikiSQL and MultiNLI.\\nFirst of all, LoRA+PE signiﬁcantly outperforms both LoRA and preﬁx-embedding tuning on\\nWikiSQL, which indicates that LoRA is somewhat orthogonal to preﬁx-embedding tuning. On\\nMultiNLI, the combination of LoRA+PE doesn’t perform better than LoRA, possibly because LoRA\\non its own already achieves performance comparable to the human baseline. Secondly, we notice\\nthat LoRA+PL performs slightly worse than LoRA even with more trainable parameters. We at-\\ntribute this to the fact that preﬁx-layer tuning is very sensitive to the choice of learning rate and thus\\nmakes the optimization of LoRA weights more difﬁcult in LoRA+PL.\\nF A DDITIONAL EMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS\\nF.1 A DDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON GPT-2\\nWe also repeat our experiment on DART (Nan et al., 2020) and WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017)\\nfollowing the setup of Li & Liang (2021).

The focus is on\\nidentifying the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters.\\nF.3 L OW-DATA REGIME\\nTo evaluate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime. we randomly\\nsample 100, 1k and 10k training examples from the full training set of MNLI to form the low-data\\nMNLI-ntasks. In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-\\nn. To our surprise, PreﬁxEmbed and PreﬁxLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with\\nPreﬁxEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%). PreﬁxLayer\\nperforms better than PreﬁxEmbed but is still signiﬁcantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI-\\n100. The gap between preﬁx-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we in-\\ncrease the number of training examples, which might suggest that preﬁx-based approaches are not\\nsuitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than ﬁne-tuning on both\\nMNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the\\n(±0.3) variance due to random seeds.\\nThe training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Ta-\\nble 17. We use a smaller learning rate for PreﬁxLayer on the MNLI-100 set, as the training loss does\\nnot decrease with a larger learning rate.\\nG M EASURING SIMILARITY BETWEEN SUBSPACES\\nIn this paper we use the measure φ(A,B,i,j ) =ψ(Ui\\nA,Uj\\nB) =∥Ui⊤\\nAUB∥2\\nF\\nmin{i,j}to measure the subspace\\nsimilarity between two column orthonormal matrices Ui\\nA∈Rd×iandUj\\nB∈Rd×j, obtained by\\ntaking columns of the left singular matrices of AandB.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2694, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6209434098084122)]"
